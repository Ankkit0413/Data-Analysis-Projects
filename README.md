## üìà Example Use Case

Imagine a cold drink supplier managing a variety of beverages distributed to retail shops. This example demonstrates how the system is used to track and manage inventory, allocate products, and record sales and receipts.

- **Purchasing Stock**: The supplier orders various drinks, updating stock levels upon arrival. This ensures an accurate view of inventory for future orders.

- **Allocating to Sales Reps**: Inventory is allocated to sales reps for distribution to retail shops, with tracking for quantities and locations, ensuring efficient stock availability.

- **Recording Sales**: Sales reps log transactions with retail shops, capturing product details, quantities, and payment status. Inventory updates in real time, providing insights into high-demand items.

- **Logging Payments**: Payments from shops are recorded, tracking amounts received and outstanding balances. This supports cash flow management and timely follow-ups.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: A Looker Studio dashboard tracks key metrics like sales volume, revenue, stock levels, and client payments, providing data for informed decision-making.
